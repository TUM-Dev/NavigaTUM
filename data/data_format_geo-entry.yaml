# This file serves as a reference for the data format.
# (Note it is for documentation purposes and not fully valid yaml)

internal_id:
  # --- Core properties ---
  
  # Same as the internal_id above.
  # The id is always lowercase may only use "-" and "." as special characters.
  # For rooms, this id is equivalent to the "SAP-Code" room id in TUMonline.
  # For buildings, this id is the 4-digit building code (as string).
  id: "internal_id"
  # While the id is commonly used to reference this entry, in some cases
  # it is visible to the user, such as in the URL. In these cases, the displayed
  # id might be replaced by this more well-known identifier.
  # E.g. building "0101" is commonly referred to as "n1".
  visible-id: "n1"
  
  # Currently the following entry types are defined:
  #  - root: An entry with no parents, that is displayed differently to a 'regular'
  #          entry with its own overview page. While there is only one entry with
  #          the id "root", there could technically be defined more than one root entry.
  #  - site: A place where buildings are located. This should group buildings that share
  #          the same directions e.g. by public transport.
  #  - campus: A site with more local infrastructure (such as food etc.)
  #  - area: A part of a site with buildings that are semantically related. Basically just
  #          a group of buildings, however they should in general by located close together.
  #  - joined_building: A large building that consists of multiple 'buildings' with each
  #                     a different 4-digit code. It should in general group everything that
  #                     one would naturally classify as one building.
  #  - building: A building identified by a 4-digit code. The Roomfinder uses "0000" as a code
  #              for buildings not in TUMonline, but they are not imported. Custom buildings
  #              should instead use a non-4-digit id. Buildings are treated differently
  #              if they are children of a "joined_building".
  #  - room: A (physical) room usually identified by its "SAP-Code". Because hallways, elevators
  #          are also imported into TUMonline as rooms, they also have the datatype "room".
  #  - virtual_room: Any indoor space that does not really match the common perception
  #                  of a 'room', e.g. a multi-floor library space or seating area.
  #  - poi: A point of interest. Generally any object that could be of interest such as
  #         student-card validators or coffee machines. Their parent should be their closest
  #         possible, e.g. a room if they are inside a room.
  #         Do not use this for semantic information about a room, e.g. "Fachschaftsbüro"
  type: one of "root", "site", "campus", "area", "joined_building", "building", "room", "virtual_room", "poi"
  
  # The common name displayed for this room, building etc. on its page.
  # It might have some additional names or abbreviations in brackets.
  name: "Fakultät Mathematik / Informatik (FMI oder MI)"
  # A shorter version of the name that might be used for overview pages, breadcrumbs etc.
  short_name: "Mathematik & Informatik (MI)"

  # --- Entry interconnection ---

  # [optional, only for areas and buildings]
  # A string or list of string identifying that all buildings whose id (4-digit-code) starts
  # with any of these strings belong to this group (since most room ids also start with
  # the building id, this also applies to most room ids).
  # Note that this does not mean that _all_ building ids of this area start with these strings.
  b_prefix: e.g. "5601" or ["15", "17"]
  # The parent ids of this entry (in order, root is first).
  parents: ["root", "garching", ...more parent ids]
  # [optional] The (short) names of the parents, used for breadcrumbs on the webpage.
  parent_names: ["Standorte", "Campus Garching", ...]
  # [optional] The list of direct children by id
  children: ["direct_child_id_1", "direct_child_id_2", ...]
  # [optional] The list of all children by id with any hierarchical depth.
  children_flat: ["flattened_child_id_1", "flattened_child_id_2", ...]
  # [optional] Lists of related entry ids.
