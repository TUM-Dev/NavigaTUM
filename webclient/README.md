# Webclient

This folder contains the JavaScript-based webclient for NavigaTUM.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

For getting started, there are some system dependencies which you will need.
Please follow the [system dependencies docs](/SYSTEM_DEPENDENCIES.md) before trying to run this part of
our project.

### Recommended IDE Setup

[Zed](https://zed.dev/) comes with a profile for all our languages out of the box.
Most modern IDEs (like the PyCharm+RustRover+WebStorm combination) should work as well.

## Dependencies

### Installing Dependencies

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Runing in development mode

Ensure a server running _NavigaTUM's API_ is available.
By default, the webclient will connect to the server on [`https://nav.tum.de/api`](https://nav.tum.de/api).  
If you want to connect to a local version instead, change the environemnt
variable `NUXT_PUBLIC_{API,CDN,FEEDBACK,MAPS}_URL` to the appropriate value.

To get a local server running, you can do so:

- either via following the [guide to local development](../server/README.md), or
- via [docker](https://docs.docker.com/) by commenting out the webclient from the docker-compose-file and running
  ```sh
  docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up --build
  ```

To run the webclient in development mode:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

### Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and formatting via prettier

```sh
pnpm run lint
pnpm run format
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

Sometimes you might want to run the type-checker and compiler separately:

```sh
pnpm run build
```

### Update the API's type definitions

The `openapi.yaml` file at the root of the project is used to generate the typescript types for the api.
From the folder of this README, run:

```sh
pnpm run type-refresh
```

## Architecture

The NavigaTUM webclient is made as a nuxt3 server side rendered application based on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
and [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/).
Our CSS framework is [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

### Directory structure (only the important parts)

```plain
webclient
â”œâ”€â”€ public/        # ðŸ ” Static assets such as icons, which cannot get inlined.
â”œâ”€â”€ api_types/     # ðŸ ” Code generated via openapi.yaml for typechecking reasons.
â”œâ”€â”€ content/       # ðŸ ” Static pages written in markdown. Served at `/about/<filename>`.
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/        # ðŸ ” Static assets such as icons.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ logos      # ðŸ ” The Logos used by the app.
â”œâ”€â”€ components/    # ðŸ ” Vue components, which are used in views.
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/         # ðŸ ” The pages are parts of App.vue, which are loaded based their file names.
â”œâ”€â”€ nuxt.config.ts # ðŸ ” Core configuration of nuxt.
â””â”€â”€ package.json   # ðŸ ” Node package definition and dependencies.
```

## Testing

> [!NOTE]
> cypress is currently temporarily disabled to help in the nuxt transition

For this part of the project, the tests consist mainly of hot-path e2e tests and tests of critical components.
PRs improving the coverage are very likely to be accepted.
The reason behind these tests is that they fundamentally increase the future productivity by allowing faster review
cycles.

### Continuous Integration

Every push and pull request triggers a build that runs linting issues (cypress is currently temporarily disabled to help
in the nuxt transition).
This helps us catch any regressions or issues early in the development process.

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter any problems while running the Cypress tests or have suggestions for improving the testing framework,
please open an issue/pull request on this repository.
We appreciate your feedback and contributions.
