# NavigaTUM Webclient

This repository contains the JavaScript based webclient for NavigaTUM.

## Getting started

### Dependencies

You need the following dependencies to get started:

- Node (for Gulp)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)
- Python (for testing)

Installing _Yarn_ and _Gulp_ with npm:

```bash
sudo npm install -g yarn gulp
```

### Images and maps

The frontend uses images and maps from the data, that are intended to be served
statically via a CDN and not provided by the API.

For a local environment, create a `cdn/` subdirectory in `weblclient/` and copy the relevant files
into it:

```bash
mkdir cdn
rsync -r --exclude '*.yaml' ../data/sources/img/ cdn/
mkdir -p cdn/maps/roomfinder
cp -r ../data/external/maps/roomfinder/* cdn/maps/roomfinder/
```

### Building

Install all npm packages:

```bash
yarn
# alternatively, if you do not use yarn:
npm install
```

And run Gulp to build the client. The build files will be written to `build/`.

```bash
# Run development build
gulp
# or run release build (will not work locally, because it uses a
# different configuration and no hash based navigation)
gulp release
```

### Testing

If you do a development build you can use a simple webserver to test the build.

Ensure that _NavigaTUM-server_ is running in the background. By default the webclient will connect to the server on `http://localhost:8080`.
If you want to connect to the public API instead, change `api_prefix` in `config-local.js` to `https://nav.tum.sexy/api/` and rebuild.

Now run:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

and open http://localhost:8000/build/index-view-main-light-de.html in your browser.

Note that local builds served this way do not support the language and theme setting.
You can choose a different base HTML instead.

## Build files & Serving release build

Gulp creates a lot of index HTML files in the build process.
Each of those files are similar but differ in some aspects.
If you serve the release build with a webserver (such as Apache or Nginx) you need
to select the correct files based on the request URL and headers.

```plain
index-view-<view>-<theme>-<lang>.html
            â†‘      â†‘       â†‘
            â”‚      â”‚       â””â”€â”€ The page language. Either "de" or "en" at the
            â”‚      â”‚           moment. It should be selected based on the
            â”‚      â”‚           "lang" Cookie or else the "Accept-Language" header.
            â”‚      â””â”€â”€ The page theme. Either "light" or "dark" at the moment.
            â”‚          It should be selected based on the "theme" Cookie and is
            â”‚          "light" by default.
            â””â”€â”€ The first loaded view (see architecture below). It does technically
                not matter which view is selected here, but this allows to efficiently
                preload resources and optimize the order of resources during initial
                pageload.
```

When running locally on a development build you can use the language and theme of
your choice as well as any view.

## Architecture

The NavigaTUM webclient is made as a single-page application based on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/). The CSS framework is [Spectre.css](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/). It is made up of a core codebase, _views_ and _modules_:

- The core codebase provides the routing functionality, as well as helper functions (e.g. to retrieve data). All of this is bundles in the `navigatum` object in JS.
- _Views_ (taking over the terminology from vue-router) are the pages displayed in NavigaTUM.
- _Modules_ provide extra functionality that is not critical or used by multiple views (e.g. the interactive map).

### Directory structure

```bash

â”œâ”€â”€ build/    # ðŸ ” Build files will be written here
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/  # ðŸ ” Static assets such as icons
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ md/      # ðŸ ” Static pages written in markdown. Served at `/about/<filename>`.

â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ interactive-map.js  # ðŸ ” Interactive map based on Mapbox
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ views/  # ðŸ ” See below
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core.js             # ðŸ ” Core JS code (and JS entrypoint)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ feedback.js         # ðŸ ” JS for the feedback form (separated from the rest of
â”‚   â”‚                       #    the code to work even when the core JS fails).
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ history-states.js   # ðŸ ” Preseve state on back-/forward navigation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ i18n.yaml           # ðŸ ” Translation strings for the core code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # ðŸ ” index.html template
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ init-call.js        # ðŸ ” Special helper-script for init on page-load
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ legacy.js           # ðŸ ” Special helper-script to automatically include some
â”‚   â”‚                       #    polyfills for older browsers.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.scss           # ðŸ ” Sass CSS code for all non-view parts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ spectre-all.scss    # ðŸ ” Include-script for Spectre.CSS
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ variables.scss      # ðŸ ” Sass CSS variable definitions (also defines themes)
â”œâ”€â”€ config.js     # ðŸ ” Build configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ gulpfile.js   # ðŸ ” Gulp configuration
â””â”€â”€ package.json  # ðŸ ” Node package definition and dependencies
```

'Views' (pages) are located in `src/views` where each view has its own subdirectory called `view-<name>`:

```bash
view-example
â”œâ”€â”€ i18n-example.yaml  # ðŸ ” Translation strings for each language
â”œâ”€â”€ view-example.inc   # ðŸ ” The HTML Template of the view
â”œâ”€â”€ view-example.js    # ðŸ ” The JS Sources of the view
â””â”€â”€ view-example.scss  # ðŸ ” The Sass CSS Sources of the view
```

Note that new views are automatically included in the build, but new JS files
in the `src/` directory are not. If you add a new JS file there you need to include
it in `gulpfile.js`.
