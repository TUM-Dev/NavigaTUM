## B. Information about the website

### Further information

For more detailed information on the processing of your data and your rights, you can contact us using the contact details given above (at the beginning of A.).

## Information on the Internet presence

### Technical implementation

Our web server is operated by the Leibniz Computing Centre of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities (LRZ).
The personal data you transmit when visiting our website is therefore processed by the LRZ on our behalf:

```plain
Leibniz Computing Centre (LRZ) of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities
Boltzmannstrasse 1
D-85748 Garching near Munich
Telephone: (089) 35831 8000
Fax: (089) 35831 9700
E-mail: lrzpost(at)lrz.de
www.lrz.de
```

### Logging

When you call up this or other Internet pages, you transmit data to our web server via your Internet browser.
The following data is temporarily recorded in a log file during an ongoing connection for communication between your internet browser and our web server:

- Date and time of the request
- Amount of time the request took
- Name of the requested file
- Page from which the file was requested
- Access status (file transferred, file not found, etc.)
- web browser and operating system used
- amount of data transferred.

**In particular, no IP addresses are logged.**

The data in this log file is processed as follows:

- The log entries are continuously evaluated automatically in order to detect attacks on the web servers and to be able to react accordingly.
- In individual cases, i.e. in the case of reported malfunctions, errors and security incidents, a manual analysis is carried out.

Since no information is logged that can be clearly traced back to individuals, it is not possible to draw conclusions about individual persons.

Log entries are automatically deleted after a maximum of 2 weeks.

### External service providers

We have no current contracts with external service providers.

### Active components

Active components such as JavaScript, Java applets or Active-X controls are used on this website.
This function can be switched off by you through the settings of your Internet browser.

## SSL encryption

To protect the security of your data during transmission, we use state-of-the-art encryption procedures (e.g. SSL) via HTTPS.

## Search queries

Search queries are not stored beyond the regular logging (see above).
However, to reduce the server's response times, queries can be cached (temporarily stored) in the server's main memory.
The caching period is a maximum of one week.

## Anonymous statistics

In order to recognise problems and to further improve the offer, anonymous statistics are collected when using the services.
These do not allow any traceability to the persons using the services.

### Cookies

Like many other websites, we also use so-called "cookies".
Cookies are small text files that are stored on your end device (laptop, tablet, smartphone or similar) when you visit our website.

You can delete individual cookies or the entire cookie inventory.
In addition, you will receive information and instructions on how to delete these cookies or block their storage in advance.

The purpose of using technically necessary cookies is to make websites easier for users to use.
Some functions of our website cannot be offered without the use of cookies.

We require cookies for the following applications:

- Adoption of language settings

This website uses these cookies solely for the purpose of storing language and theme settings.
A corresponding, non-personal, cookie is only set when the default setting is changed.

## C. Information on individual processing

### Feedback

When contacting us via a feedback form, the user's details are processed for the purpose of handling the contact enquiry and its processing pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) DSGVO.
A traceability to the person is only possible insofar as personal data is contained in the sent text.
In addition to the data provided by the user, the room about which feedback was given, the date and the time of the feedback creation are also sent.
It is also stored whether the user wishes the transmitted data to be deleted after the feedback processing has been completed.

#### Recipient

The transmitted feedback is stored publicly accessible on [GitHub](https://github.com/TUM-Dev/navigatum/issues) as part of our commitment to transparency.
This means that they are not technically limited to one group of people.
The user is presented with an issue link to track the processing of the feedback.
If the user has requested immediate deletion, this function can no longer be technically provided.

#### Provision mandatory or required

The provision of this non-personal data is voluntary.
