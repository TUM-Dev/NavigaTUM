The processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO.

the [Tearms of Service and GitHub Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy) must be agreed to.

#### Navigation - Location

Navigation is used on a purely voluntary basis.
The processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.
When using the navigation, users can enter their current location as a starting point in addition to addresses or rooms.
This is then transmitted to our server and the route is returned to the user.

#### Map - location

The use of navigation is purely voluntary.
The processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.
While using the map, users can have their own location displayed on the map.

If necessary, your data will be transmitted to the competent supervisory and auditing authorities for the exercise of

prevent threats to information technology security and processed there on the basis of Art. 12 et seq. of the Bavarian
E-Government Act.

### Duration of storage of personal data

#### Feedback

The data voluntarily provided by a user will not be technically deleted unless the user so requests.

In addition, a user can have his or her comment deleted by us at any time.
To do so, please write an e-mail to us (navigatum (at-symbol) tum.de) and provide the link to your comment.
In addition, you can also contact the data protection officer listed below and/or the person responsible for data
protection.

#### Navigation - Location

The data is discarded after the navigation route has been calculated and is therefore not saved.

#### Map - Location

The data is not transmitted to our server and is therefore not saved.

## Your rights

If we process your personal data, you have the following rights as a data subject:

- You have the right to information about the data stored about you (Art. 15 DSGVO).

  time for the future.
  The lawfulness of the data processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation is not affected by
  this.

You have the right to object to the processing of your data at any time on grounds relating to your particular

## B. Information about the website

### Further information

For more detailed information on the processing of your data and your rights, you can contact us using the contact
details given above (at the beginning of A.).

## Information on the Internet presence

### Technical implementation

Our web server is operated by the Leibniz Computing Centre of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities (LRZ).
The personal data you transmit when visiting our website is therefore processed by the LRZ on our behalf:

```plain
Leibniz Computing Centre (LRZ) of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities
Boltzmannstrasse 1
D-85748 Garching near Munich
Telephone: (089) 35831 8000
Fax: (089) 35831 9700
E-mail: lrzpost(at)lrz.de

```

### Logging

When you call up this or other Internet pages, you transmit data to our web server via your Internet browser.
The following data is temporarily recorded in a log file during an ongoing connection for communication between your
internet browser and our web server:

- Date and time of the request
- Amount of time the request took
- Name of the requested file
- Page from which the file was requested
- Access status (file transferred, file not found, etc.)
- web browser and operating system used
- amount of data transferred.

**In particular, no IP addresses or locations are logged.**

The data in this log file is processed as follows:

- The log entries are continuously evaluated automatically in order to detect attacks on the web servers and to be able
  to react accordingly.
- In individual cases, i.e. in the case of reported malfunctions, errors and security incidents, a manual analysis is
  carried out.

Since no information is logged that can be clearly traced back to individuals, it is not possible to draw conclusions
about individual persons.

Log entries are automatically deleted after a maximum of 2 weeks.

### External service providers

We have no current contracts with external service providers.

### Active components

Active components such as JavaScript, Java applets or Active-X controls are used on this website.
This function can be switched off by you through the settings of your Internet browser.

## SSL encryption

To protect the security of your data during transmission, we use state-of-the-art encryption procedures (e.g. SSL) via
HTTPS.

## Search queries

Search queries are not stored beyond the regular logging (see above).
However, to reduce the server's response times, queries can be cached (temporarily stored) in the server's main memory.
The caching period is a maximum of one week.

## Anonymous statistics

In order to recognise problems and to further improve the offer, anonymous statistics are collected when using the
services.
These do not allow any traceability to the persons using the services.

### Cookies

Like many other websites, we also use so-called "cookies".
Cookies are small text files that are stored on your end device (laptop, tablet, smartphone or similar) when you visit
our website.

You can delete individual cookies or the entire cookie inventory.

## C. Information on individual processing

### Feedback

When contacting us via a feedback form, the user's details are processed for the purpose of handling the contact enquiry

A traceability to the person is only possible insofar as personal data is contained in the sent text.

feedback creation are also sent.
It is also stored whether the user wishes the transmitted data to be deleted after the feedback processing has been
completed.

If the user has requested immediate deletion, this function can no longer be technically provided.
