      no_browser_support: |
        We're sorry, but it seems that your browser does not support WebGL, which is required to display the map.
        WebGL is a technology that enables interactive 3D graphics directly in the web browser, and unfortunately, your browser does not seem to have this capability.
      please_try: "To resolve this issue and view the map, we recommend trying one of the following:"
      upgrade_browser: |
        Upgrade your current browser to the latest version, as newer versions often include support for WebGL.
        You can visit the official website of your browser to download and install the latest update.
      try_different_browser: |
        Alternatively, you can try using a different browser that supports WebGL.
        Popular browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge are known to have WebGL capabilities.
        Consider installing one of these browsers and accessing the map again.
