          # RUSTSEC-2024-0384 = instant (Used via instant v0.1.13 > parking_lot v0.11.2 > sled v0.34.7 > cached v0.54.0) is unmaintained => Since `parking_lot`, `sled` and `cached` are maintained and the open issues in `instant` are wasm-related, I am going to close this
          # RUSTSEC-2024-0379 = unsoundness in fast-float => only used in intialisation logic, fix in polars is in main and is awaiting release
          # RUSTSEC-2024-0363 = Binary Protocol Misinterpretation caused by Truncating or Overflowing Casts => caught by maximum request sizes
          # RUSTSEC-2023-0071 = Marvin Attack: potential key recovery through timing sidechannels => not used explitably
