# Calendar

This folder contains the calendar-API server for NavigaTUM.

This is separated from the server because:

- it has virtually no shared dependencies (natural fault line)
- this way, we can deploy the calendar-API independently of the main server.
  The Reason why this is important is, that scraping calendar entries is expensive for TUMOnline.
  => We have to be resourcefully and can't waste this scraped state by redeploying at will
  => Making this a StatefulSet instead of a Deployment makes sense

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

For getting started, there are some system dependencys which you will need.
Please follow the [system dependencys docs](resources/documentation/Dependencys.md) before trying to run this part of our project.

### How to Set up the Sqlite Database

#### Getting the data

To populate the database, you will need to get said data.
There are multiple ways to do this, but the easiest way is to download the data from our [website](https://nav.tum.de/).

(Assuming you are in the `calendar` directory)

```bash
mkdir -p data
wget -P data https://nav.tum.de/cdn/api_data.json
```

Alternatively, you can run the `data` part of this project and generate this file by that part of our docs.
To link the output directory to the server data directory, so that you don't need to copy on every update you can use:

```bash
ln -s ../data/output data
```

#### Setting up the database

To set up the database, you will need to run the `load_api_data_to_db.py` script:

```bash
python3 load_api_data_to_db.py
```

### Starting the server

Run `cargo run` to start the server.
The server should now be available on `localhost:8081`.

Note that `cargo run --release` is used to start the server for an optimised production build (use this if you want to profile performance, it makes quite a difference).

### API-Changes

#### Editing

If you have made changes to the API, you need to update the API documentation.

There are two editors for the API documentation (both are imperfect):

- [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TUM-Dev/navigatum/main/openapi.yaml)
- [stoplight](stoplight.io)

#### Testing

Of course documentation is one part of the process. If the changes are substantial, you should also run an API-Fuzz-Test:
To make sure that this specification is up-to-date and without holes, we run [schemathesis](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis) using the following command on API Server:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install schemathesis
st run --workers=auto --base-url=http://localhost:8060 --checks=all ../openapi.yaml
```

Some fuzzing-goals may not be available for you locally, as they require prefix-routing (f.ex.`/cdn` to the CDN) and some fuzzing-goals are automatically tested in our CI.  
You can exchange `--base-url=http://localhost:8081` to `--base-url=https://nav.tum.sexy` for the full public API, or restrict your scope using a option like `--endpoint=/api/calendar/`.
