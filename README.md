# NavigaTUM
NavigaTUM is a non-official tool developed by students for students, that aims to help you get around at [TUM](https://tum.de). Feel free to contribute.

Features:
- Interactive or RoomFinder-like maps to lookup the position of rooms or buildings
- Fast and typo-tolerant search
- Support for different room code formats as well as generic names

All functionality is also available via an API.

*Note: Not all buildings in NavigaTUM are owned by TUM, but are instead being used by TUM departments.*
