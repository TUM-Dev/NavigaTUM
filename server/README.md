# Server

Our server is architected as a single monolith (with low coupling, chill).
The reason behind this is that we are a very small team (=mostly a singe dev) and
limit ourselves to the service itself.

Please see the [main-api](/server/main-api) for the main API server, which serves the API endpoints
