# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any and all security vulnerabilities you found, or you think you found at navigatum (at) tum.de .  
We will diagnose the issue internally and propose a fix.
The timeline of a fix depends on how severe the problem is and what impacts it has.
As a reward for reporting such vulnerabilities you can get exclusive stickers at the MPI student council office or other small things.
