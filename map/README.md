# NavigaTUM-maps

This folder contains the static maps tileserver and vector tiles server for NavigaTUM.

## Getting started

As a basis of generating images it is important to have a tileset (`output.mbtiles`) and a stile.
The style is a JSON file that defines how the map should look like.
The tileset is a sqlite database that contains the map data.
A tileserver takes these two components and produces a variety of formats (png, webp, json, etc.) for the frontend.

### 0. generate your own tileset

Sadly tilesets are really large (`europe` is ca. 30GB, `planet` ca. 80GB).
Because of limited badwith and storage space we can't provide a tileset for everyone.
You can generate your own tileset from [OpenStreetMap Data](https://osmdata.openstreetmap.de/) via [planettiler](https://github.com/onthegomap/planetiler) or other equivalent tools.

From our experience the best way to generate a tileset is to use [planettiler](https://github.com/onthegomap/planetiler), as their perofrmance is by far (other competitors are not even close by our tests) the best, and they can work in resourece constreained environments.

From a resource perspective, you need about 2x the size of the tileset as free space on your disk and above 10GB in free RAM.  
If you really need a tileset and can't meet these requirements, shoot us a message, and we'll see what we can do.  
Generating `europe` takes 3h10m on a modern laptop with 32GB RAM and an SSD. The following commands are optimised for this.

From the root of the repository, run:

```bash
docker run -it -e JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="-Xmx10g" -v "$(pwd)/map":/data ghcr.io/onthegomap/planetiler:latest --download --area=europe --languages=de,en --Xmx10g --storage=mmap
```

For `planet`, you might want to increase the `--Xmx` parameter to 20GB. For 128GB of RAM or more you will want to use `--storage=ram` instead of `--storage=mmap`.

### 1. serve the tileset

After generating `output.mbtiles` you can serve it with a tileserver.
We use [tileserver-gl](https://github.com/maptiler/tileserver-gl) for this, but there are other ones out there.
This may be one optimisation point in the future.

From the root of the repository, run:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd)/map:/data -p 7770:80 maptiler/tileserver-gl
```

### 2. Edit the style

For editing the style we use [Maputnik](https://github.com/maputnik/editor).
It is a web-based editor for Mapbox styles.
You can use it to edit the style and see the changes live.

Sadly, it is not fully compatible with tileserver-gl.

While maputnik expects the data on an url, tileserver-gl expects it to be a file.
More concretely, maputnik expects this:

```json
{
"openmaptiles": {
  "type": "vector",
  "url": "http://localhost:7770/data/openmaptiles.json"
},
...
}
```

tileserver-gl expects this

```json
{
"openmaptiles": {
  "type": "vector",
  "url": "mbtiles://output.mbtiles"
},
...
}
```

To edit the style you thus need to run maputnik and tileserver-gl at the same time.
Change the style to the version maputnik expects.
You cannot preview the style in tileserver-gl, but you can see the changes in maputnik.

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 maputnik/editor
```

After exporting the edited style don't forget to revert the change to the vector url ðŸ˜‰
